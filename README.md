# Modulation of Severe Hailstorms in Alberta by Large-Scale Climate Teleconnections

Overview
This repository contains scripts used for analyzing the relationship between severe hailstorms in Alberta and large-scale climate teleconnections, including MEI, NAO, AO, PDO, MJO, AMO, and PNA. The code processes climate indices, radar-derived storm characteristics, and precipitation data to evaluate statistical linkages and trends.

Repository Contents
